            <p>It was just a gym on Instagram—all over SportsCenter, ESPN, Overtime, and the other sports pages— exclusive to NBA players, celebrities, and rich white people. That’s what I thought; what most people think. Never would I ever have imagined myself in there. An average middle-class New Yorker on the same stage as LeBron James. But there I was, in a gym in the center of New York City.

            <p>February 17th, 2021. I walk onto the packed court and see masks soaked with sweat. The wet towels and half-naked men in the locker room. The clanging of the machines and men grunting on the 11th Floor gym. It had only been a few days since their reopening. While the rest of the world was still stuck behind covid, New York City was already back.
                <br></p>

        <div id="text" class="text">
            <p>Since I joined this community, I have met hundreds of people. Many of whose names I never found out. That one friendly white guy who wore glasses and would pick me up every game. The workers in the cafe that make that $16 chicken quesadilla and the $9 smoothie so worth it. The people that have been there from the beginning. There’s Moe, who my friends and I used to call dreads. We thought of him as the best player in the gym—probably because he was in the NBA. He used to play every pickup game with us but now he just does his own workouts and helps others get better. Stan is this 6’8 guy who I beat at pool every time. I had thought his name was Malik and he never corrected me so it was a bit embarrassing. “Regulars” is what I call them. The ones that are there almost every day. They may all have their own idea of New York City, but nevertheless, these people are what make LifeTime, and separate us from the outside world.

            <p>This is what I love about New York City. One minute I can be in Times Square pushing through the thousands of tourists, and the next minute I can be in a whole different New York City. One where I can relate to everybody else. In the most unexpected place, I found my community.
                <br></p>
            </div>
        <div id="text" class="text">
            <p>Throughout the past year and a half, I have found that many of the people here have already found success: business owners, college athletes, and stock traders. To them, it may be a place to relax: wind down in the spa or sunbathe on the Skydeck. The others are those searching for that success. Those who, even after a long day at school or work, make the time to hit the gym—suffering the early mornings and late nights, and leave with a sore and cramping body. This is where you find the true New Yorkers, those who show up every day to get just a little bit better—those who never stop going.
